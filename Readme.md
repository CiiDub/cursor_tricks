# Cursor Tricks

_*Warning: This readme is ..._ 🤔  _self-indulgent._

Cursor Tricks is a BBEdit package that massages the app to work better with my habits and intuition, using customizations I made or found. Most of these scripts, clippings and such are grounded or anchored to a native BBEdit command. Often I’m just trying to lean into a muscle memory.

 “If I can move a line down, it would be nice if I could copy a line down in a similar way.” 

 “If this key-command does this work in this context it should do that in another.“

This is the kind of work I want this package to do. Little friction reducers that don’t take you out of what your doing, and are harmonious with the BBedit defaults.

It’s my throw rug for my text editor. I think it really brings the room together. 

## Installation, and Rake Commands

Download or clone this project. Give it the file extension .bbpackage and double click it. BBedit will install it into _~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Packages_. This will not install the menu scripts. There are further instructions below. 

All the AppleScripts in this package are in sub-folders of the folder _Uncompiled Applescripts_. These are plain text versions of the scripts. The compiled versions are in a corresponding folder under _Contents_ and are the versions used by BBedit. 

The Menu Scripts are different. They are in the package only in a plain text version. You can open them with Script Editor and save them into _~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Menu Scripts_ as compiled scripts. There are [Rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake) commands to help install and manage the package if you wish.

Any of these scripts can be copied and installed outside of the package of course.

### Rake commands

- __rake install__, installs this project as a Cursor Tricks.bbpackage into BBedits Packages folder. It runs backup, and compile as prerequisites before installing the package.
- __rake compile__, compiles all applescripts except the menu scripts.
- __rake backup__, backs up the installed (and presumably working) copy of this package as Cursor Tricks.backup.
- __rake lines:compile__, compiles all applescripts in the Lines directory.
- __rake white\_space:compile__, compiles all applescripts in White Space.
- __rake resources:compile__, compiles all applescripts in resources.
- __* rake menu\_scripts:install__, compiles & installs into ../BBedit/Menu Scripts/. It doesn’t run as part of the install command, you must run this command explicitly.
- __rake -T__ to list these commands.

## Scripts

### Lines:

- __Copy Line Down__, takes the selected lines duplicates them as new lines. The new lines, below the originals, will be selected. Sort of moving down the document.
- __Copy Line Up__, duplicates the selected lines but leaves the selection put.

These a two scripts are meant as to compliments BBedits __Edit > Lines > Move Line Down__ & __Edit > Lines > Move Line Up__. The two native commands have the default keyboard shortcuts of __⌃ ↓__ &  __⌃ ↑__. So I use and recommend the shortcuts  __⌃ ⌥ ↓__ &  __⌃ ⌥ ↑__ respectively.

- __Smart Home Move__, moves the cursor to start of the line not including prepended white space.
- __Smart Home Select__, selects to the start of the line not including prepended white space.

These two are meant to replace  the default behavior of __⌃ ←__ and __⌃ ⇧ ←__ . 
They are pulled directly from this blog post. It’s well written and worth a read. 
[Extending BBEdit with AppleScript](https://jonbeebe.net/2017/07/extending-bbedit-with-applescript/)

I made a small change to make them work in search fields. Kind of a hack and will bring up a security dialog.
It tell System Events to keystroke _⌘ ↑_. Which takes you to the beginning of a document. In a search field that is a pretty good fallback.

### White Space: 
_\* The cursor will be represented with a_ |

- __Wrap with Spaces__, wraps the cursor or selection in spaces.

```
It makes this, {|}  
Into this, { | }
```

This script could be a BBEdit clipping. But making it a script seems appropriate, and keeps it from popping up in code suggestions. 
 
- __Clever  Indent__, looks at the text on the current line, then changes and indents the next line according to what it sees.


The default behavior is to make a new line and indent it.  
This should works great for languages and markup with significant indentation like Python and Haml.

```
Text|

Text
    |
``` 

If it detects one of these characters __(, {, [, “, ‘, \`__ (bracket characters), or a xml/html tag on the leading side of the cursor it will close it wrapping the cursor. 

```
{|  

{|}
```

```HTML
<div>|

<div>|</div>
```

If you use a tag but you don’t have the document type set to a markup language , it will start the closing tag for you but you will have to finish the name.

```HTML
<div>|

<div></|
```

If the cursor is wrapped in bracket characters it will make two new lines and indent the first one.  

```Javascript
function () {|} 

function () {
    |
}
```

It works the same for tags.

```HTML
<div>|</div>

<div>
	|
</div>
```

If it detects a Ruby key word or control statement it will make two new lines indenting the first one and adding the _end_ statement. 

```Ruby

Array.each do |

Array.each do
    |
end

```

Currently the script will close a tag in these doc types : HTML, XML, Ruby in HTML, PHP in HTML. Your “_Language in HTML_” can be added pretty easy. Add it to  _markup\_docs_ a list set near the top of the script (line 31).

The __Cleaver Indent__ script was inspired by this: [Smart New Line](http://www.angelwatt.com/words/2011/04/11/bbedit-smart-newline-open-line/). I was actually shopping for something ruby specific but ran across this. I was impressed by how flexible it was. _Smart New Line_ does more than my script, such as incrementing numbered list. It’s pretty cool and you should check it out, but it doesn’t quite fit for me.

I use auto-pairing for bracket characters. I wanted my script to know when the cursor was wrapped. 

Also I wanted it to fit with BBedits __New Line After Paragraph__. It uses the key-command _command ↵_ and will make a new line without disturbing the current line / paragraph. Kind of jumping you down there.

I set __Clever Indent__ to __⌘  ⌥ ↵__. It’s function is to encapsulate. So “_{}_” from a Javascript function, ” _do end_” from a Ruby block, or  a new line with and indent with Python or Haml. It might make sense for it to indent and name a new section of an outline but not to increment a flat list.

The script doesn’t just insert text but inserts a BBedit clipping. It’s useful because I can take advantage of clippings features. Such as the #INDENT# placeholder, so I don’t have to be concerned with capturing the current lines leading whitespace.

I also made  __Clever Indent__ respect expanded tabs with a separate terse script “_ex\_tabs.scpt_” that is called by it’s clippings and lives right there in _Contents/Resources/_. It simplifies the big script and can be used by any clipping (or AppleScript) added in the future.

So my mental model is:

- __↵__ for a new line at the cursor.
- __⌘ ↵__ for a new line ignoring the cursor position. 
- __⌘ ⌥ ↵__ to encapsulate the cursor or new line.

I like this a lot. I find I’m simplifying my Clippings and using less of them. I don’t have to think ahead just to use a fancy clipping with a bunch of placeholders. This works really well with me in the flow of things.

### Menu Scripts

- __Window•Scratchpad & Window•Unix Worksheet__, activates the project versions of Scratchpad and Unix Worksheet if a project window is active.

This is my favorite, because it uses my three favorite features in BBEdit.

_Menu Scripts_ let you prepend a script to a native menu command and optionally continue with command. As well as append a script so it runs after the command. Just a great idea.

_Scratchpad_ is a persistent document in BBedit. The name really kind of says it. It doesn’t sound like much but in practice it’s great.

_Unix Worksheets_ are documents that will execute shell commands when you __⌃ ↵__ a line. It’s the command line meets a text document. You can make and save as many as you like but BBedit also has a persistent one available through the _Window_ menu just like Scratchpad.

I have these two persistent documents assigned to __⌘ 1__ and __⌘ 2__ respectively.

What I recently discovered was that every BBEdit project also get a Scratchpad and a persistent Unix Worksheet. With this script the project versions are just as easy to activate. __⌘ 1__ and __⌘ 2__ in my case, when a project is the frontmost window.

If you wish to access the app level documents while leaving a project in front, then hold __⌥__ and activate them from the _Window_ menu. You can also get them by right clicking the BBEdit icon in the dock.

- __Lines•New Line After Paragraph__, captures the leading white space from the current line, then applies it to the new line. 

I found that I pretty much always want auto indenting. This command can save you a little “arrowing” around but it’s pointless if you have to tab over to your current indention. 

- __Search•Find & Select All__ after selection is made , it brings Document 1 forward if Find Window is the frontmost window. The default key command is __⌘ ⌥ ⌃ G__, which is in a family of __⌘ G__ and __⌘ E__ key commands that are pretty powerful when used in combination.

- __Select•Live Search Results__ after selection, dismisses Live Find bar so you can edit selection immediately.

Both these scripts exist for the same reason. I feel if a command makes a selection that selection should immediately be available to edit. It frustrates me every time I have to dismiss an iterface element to get to my selection.

The command _Select > Live Search Results_ has a sister command called _Select > Highlighted Matches_. When the curser is over a word BBEdit will “highlight” every other occurrence. Hit the command and it will select them all for editing. I set it to -and I’m kind of proud of this- __⌘ ⌥ ⌃ H__. It is so much like _Search•Find & Select All_ with __⌘ ⌥ ⌃ G__. The functionality is basically the same and _H_ both stands for highlight and is next to _G_. I truly think it should be the default.

I also think __⌘ ⌥ ⌃ G__ should do double duty and run _Select > Live Search Results_ if live search is open. I haven’t figured out a way to make that happen. Well, I have an idea but it would litter up the script menu and I don’t use live search that much anyway.

## Planned Maybe Additions

- Maybe add some fancy list stuff Copy Line Down script with.
- Probably should add some AppleScript affordances  to Clever Indent script.
- Add some outlining features to Clever Indent
